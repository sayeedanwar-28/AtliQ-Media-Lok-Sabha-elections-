### Problem Statement  
AtliQ Media, a private media company wants to telecast a show on Lok Sabha elections in 2024 in India. Unlike other channel they do not want to have debate on who is going to win the elections, they rather wanted to present the insights from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss the less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in India.

### Tools used 

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook

## Observations

- Highest voter turnout ratio is seen in North eastern states whereas lowest in Jammu & Kashmir.
- BJP party has highest percentage of vote share followed by INC.
- Highest NOTA votes were polled in tribal areas like Nilgiris, Aruku.
- Male candidates are participating more on elections  compared to female candidates.

## Recommendations 

- Increase in security, curbing fake news in social media to increase voter turnout ratio in riots prone areas like Jammu & Kashmir.
- Voter awareness programmes should be conducted in tribal areas by government using political parties, celebrities, influencers.
- Right to reject for NOTA votes.
- Home voting for people with disabilities and people above the age of 85 years is a positive move, steps to increase  NRI votes should be taken.
